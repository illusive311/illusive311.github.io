My Github account was created for learning purposes at Wake Tech Community College. 

The repository I created is for learing purposes.  

I went created a new repository on Github.com, I then opend the Github Desktop application and found the "Clone Repository" option under the "File" tab (the "+" icon mentioned in the instructions provided did not exist and created confusion).  I chose my only repository available (illusive311.github.io) and creaetd a new location on my machine's hard drive.
